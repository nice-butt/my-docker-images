# Docker image playground

## Why I have this repo
This repo holds Dockerfile's for docker images that can potentially be useful or interesting. The images are in repos of docker.io/victordrz2019.

The other fact is I realize how docker is useful and interesting as well as handy in building things in linux environment on my MacOSX. It has been so long that I could not do experiments merely because I don't have a linux machine. Now docker frees me.

## What I have right now
This is just a start. I only have one image packing ubuntu 18, bazel and protobuf together
